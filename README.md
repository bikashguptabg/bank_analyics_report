## Primary Objective

## Secondary Objectives

- **Achieve Measurable Improvements in Key Metrics:** Track and analyze critical business metrics to ensure continuous improvement and align with organizational goals.
- **Gain Data-Driven Insights into Operations and Strategies:** Use data analytics to inform decision-making, identify trends, and uncover opportunities for strategic improvements.
- **Optimize Loan Portfolio and Manage Risk:** Balance the portfolio by promoting low-risk loans and tightening credit approvals where necessary to minimize defaults.
- **Enhance Security and Protect Against Fraud:** Strengthen the bank's security measures to safeguard customer data and prevent fraudulent activities.
- **Improve Customer Experience and Loyalty:** Enhance the loan application process and customer service to increase satisfaction and foster long-term loyalty.
- **Drive Business Growth and Stay Competitive:** Implement innovative solutions and strategies to maintain a competitive edge in the financial services industry.

## Final Recommendations

1. **Tighten Credit Approval for Small Business Loans:** Given the high percentage of bad loans in this segment, stricter credit checks and additional collateral requirements are advised to reduce risk.
  
2. **Increase Focus on Mortgage Loans:** Mortgage loans have a lower risk profile; therefore, aggressive promotion and targeted marketing campaigns should be implemented to capitalize on this opportunity.

3. **Target Renters in California:** Develop specific loan products and incentives for renters, who represent a significant market segment in California. This strategy aims to increase market share in the state by addressing the unique needs of renters.

4. **Address Q4 Application Declines for Grade A Loans:** Investigate the decline in Grade A loan applications during Q4 and introduce promotions or incentives to maintain a steady flow of high-quality applications during this period.

5. **Leverage 36-Month Term Popularity for Grade A Loans:** Since the majority of Grade A borrowers prefer 36-month terms, create new products or incentives to enhance the appeal of these loans, potentially increasing both volume and profitability.

6. **Optimize Loan Plans in High-Risk Segments:** Focus on reducing defaults in 60-month term loans, where bad loans are disproportionately high. Introduce flexible repayment options and incentives for timely payments to improve overall loan performance.

7. **Diversify and Expand Credit Assessment Tools:** Implement advanced credit evaluation tools to better assess borrower risk and adjust interest rates accordingly to remain competitive.

## Conclusion

By strategically optimizing the loan portfolio, enhancing credit assessment processes, and focusing on targeted market segments, this project aims to improve the bank's financial performance while ensuring customer satisfaction and loyalty.
